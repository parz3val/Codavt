    "**The `with` statement** \n",
    "The with statement is used to wrap the execution of a block with methods defined by a context manager.\n",
    "The execution of with staement with one 'item' proceeds as follow:\n",
    "1. The context expression is evaluated to obtain the context manager.\n",
    "2. The context manager's `__enter__()` is loaded for later use.\n",
    "3. The context manager's `__exit__()` is loaded for later use\n",
    "4. The context manager's `__enter__()` is invoked.\n",
    "5. If a target was included in the with statement, the return value from `__enter__()` is assigned to it.\n",
    "6. The suite is executed.\n",
    "7. The context managers `__exit__()` method is invoked. If exception occurs, its type, value and traceback are passed as arguments to `__exit__()`, otherwise `None` arguments are supplied.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the suite was exited due to an exception, and return value from the `__exit__()` was false, the exception is reraised.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the return value was true, the exception is suppressed, and execution with the statement after `with` continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the exit was due to any other reason than exception, the return value from `__exit__()` is ignored, and execution proceeds at the normal location for the kind of exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple example of context managers is `with` `open` operation.**"
