# Twilio Limitations

## Support

- Non existent tech support
- No sales/billing support for Nepal
- No phone support. Email ticketing takes a lot of time. Often 3-7 days
- No support for developer license accounts
- Documentation dated. TwiML and API workflow is confusing, but there is no more support for developers.
- Auto address verification and address verification support is trivial

## Pricing

- Expensive compared to similarly featured platforms
- Not available in some countries and mobile number prices outrageous.

## Technology

- Call recording

  - Call Tagging
  - Distributed call recording (doesn't allow call control on our end)
  - Event triggered recording (doens't allow selective event triggered call recoding)
  - Scheduled call recording

- IVR
  Twilio has good IVR designer in the Twilio Studio. The IVR can be used to do TaskRouting and creating the necessary workflows for the multiple teams.

  - Multiple scripts
  - Voice customization

   - Pricing

     - **Numbers**: Cheaper phone numbers compared to other cPaaS Services. For instance an AU number with just voice capability costs $6 in twilio but costs about 1.64$ with vonage. Toll free customer service numbers are also $4 cheaper (11.96 with Vonage and $15 with Twilio). Vonage also has better availability for the phone numbers and call. But, it doesn't have good carrier grade support for some countries like Japan, where the price for voice number is nearly $17 expensive than Twilio.

     - **Voice calls**: Vonage call prices are cheaper than twilio except for some tier 1 countries. (For instance for AU calls its .01 more than twilio)

     - **SMS**: We can send SMS for cheaper to many countries with Vonage. The cost of SMS is also cheaper compared to Twilio for some countries but the SMS enabled numbers cost a lot for some countries, a lot. SMS enabled number for the Japan costs over $1600+ per month compared to trivial $4.5 with Twilio. But cost for sending SMS is not that different for most countries and most numbers do come with SMS enabled features.
